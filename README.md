# mac4win11
A custom keyboard layout for Windows 11, mapped for Mac keyboards

# Instructions
1. Download the file to your local machine
2. Unzip it
3. Scan the files using Windows Defender (because you always should)
4. Run the setup.exe to install the keyboard layout
5. Navigate to Settings - Typing Settings - Advanced Keyboard Settings - Set your keyboard layout to "United Kingdom - Layout01 Description"
6. You're done!

Don't ask me why it's called "Layout01 Description", it seems the DDL compiler ignores the description I set, but it works nontheless.

Enjoy :)
