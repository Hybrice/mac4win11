# mac4win11

Does your Mac keyboard turn into an Enigma machine when used on Windows? Fix it with this!

A custom keyboard layout for Windows 11, mapped for Mac keyboards and compiled using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4

# Instructions
1. Download the "mac4win11.zip" compressed file to your local machine
2. Unzip it
3. Scan the files using Windows Defender (because you always should)
4. Run the setup.exe to install the keyboard layout
5. Navigate to:
    1. Settings
    2. Typing Settings (use search if you can't see it)
    3. Advanced Keyboard Settings
    4. Set your keyboard layout to "United Kingdom - Mac for Windows 11"
6. That's it!

"#" and "â‚¬" can be accssed by pressing Ctrl/Control and Alt/Option then 2 or 3 respectively, or use the right-side Alt/Option key (which counts as both Ctrl and Alt), either works.

If you wish to remove the keyboard layout, first change your selected layout to something else, then remove it via "add or remove programs"

Enjoy :)
